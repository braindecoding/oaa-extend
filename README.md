FID calculation must be done separately because it utilizes multi-threading, so it cannot be combined into a single file.  

## Van Gerven Dataset  

To run tests using the Van Gerven dataset, execute:  

```sh
runvg.bat
```  

This script will run the Python scripts `dgmmvangerven.py` and `fidvg.py`.  

- **`oaavangerven.py`**: Performs image reconstruction with MSE error, generating an output folder for each hyperparameter, which contains subfolders with the reconstruction results.  
- **`fidvg.py`**: Calculates the FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) from the `stim` folder, which contains the original stimuli, and the `rec` folder, which contains the reconstruction results from `dgmmvangerven.py`.  

## Miyawaki Dataset  

Miyawaki dataset generated by [slr code repository](https://github.com/braindecoding/slr).  
To perform reconstruction on the Miyawaki dataset, execute:  

```sh
runmy.bat
```  

This script will run the Python scripts `dgmmmiyawaki.py` and `fid.py`.  

- **`oaamiyawaki.py`**: Performs image reconstruction with MSE error, generating an output folder for each hyperparameter, which contains subfolders with the reconstruction results.  
- **`fidmy.py`**: Calculates the FID from the `stim` folder, which contains the original stimuli, and the `rec` folder, which contains the reconstruction results from `dgmmmiyawaki.py`.  


## Installation using uv VirtualEnv

```sh
uv python install 3.8
uv venv --python 3.8
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run on Multiple GPUS

If your server has multiple GPUs, you can specify which GPU to use by setting the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.  
To do this, edit line 11 in your script:

```py
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "3"  # Change to "2" to use GPU2, or "0" for GPU0
```

This ensures that only the specified GPU will be visible to TensorFlow.
